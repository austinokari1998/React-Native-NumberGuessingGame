# Number Guessing Game

The number Guessing Game is just as it sounds. A number guessing  game. The user provides a number and the phone has to randomly gues what the user had as an input. 
If the number guessed by the phone is greater, feel free to instruct that the number is greater than the one expected. If number predicted is lesser, then instruct it as so. 
The app is generally supposed to give a deeper dive into the following three things
* Use of hooks, useState, useEffect mostly.
* Navigation by use of states between screens.
* Stylesheet styling of the app layout.
